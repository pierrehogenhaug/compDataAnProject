ID no. / Team no. / puzzler
- Each experiment day has 2-4 teams of 2 participants. 
	- Participants are labeled 1-8 and teams are labeled [1-4]
	- On day D11 there were 8 participants, they therefore have IDs 1-8 and teams 1-4.
	- On day D11 there were 6 participants, they therefore have have IDs 1-6 and teams 1-3
	- On day D131 there were 4 participants, they therefore have have IDs 1-4 and teams 1-2
	- On day D132 there were 4 participants, they therefore have have IDs 1-4 and teams 1-2
	- On day D133 there were 2 participants, they therefore have have IDs 1-2 and teams 1
	- On day D134 there were 2 participants, they therefore have have IDs 1-2 and teams 1
We thus have many identical ID numbers and Team numbers. 
When I conduct analysis on the combined data, how can I distinguish the different ID number and team numbers.
