ID no. / Team no. / puzzler
- Each experiment day has 2-4 teams of 2 participants. They are listed in the "team_info" csv file. A distinct version of this file exists within each experiment day folder. The structure of the file is as follows: 

"	ID	Team	Puzzler
0	ID_1	2	1
1	ID_2	2	0
2	ID_3	1	0
3	ID_4	3	1
4	ID_5	3	0
5	ID_6	4	0
6	ID_7	4	1
7	ID_8	1	1
"
As we can see, Participants are labeled ID_1 - ID_8, teams are labeled [1-4] and Puzzler is binary [0,1] (0 for no, 1 for yes).

The problem is that the "team_info" has identical naming convention in all experiment day folder.
	- On day D11 there were 8 participants, they therefore have IDs 1-8 and teams 1-4.
	- On day D11 there were 6 participants, they therefore have have IDs 1-6 and teams 1-3
	- On day D131 there were 4 participants, they therefore have have IDs 1-4 and teams 1-2
	- On day D132 there were 4 participants, they therefore have have IDs 1-4 and teams 1-2
	- On day D133 there were 2 participants, they therefore have have IDs 1-2 and teams 1
	- On day D134 there were 2 participants, they therefore have have IDs 1-2 and teams 1
We thus have many identical ID numbers and Team numbers. 
When I conduct analysis on the combined data, how can I distinguish the different ID number and team numbers.
